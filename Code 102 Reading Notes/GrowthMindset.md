# Growth Mindset
A ***Growth Mindset*** thinks that someone's skills may be developed via hard work and effort.
When someone with a __Growth Mindset__ faces a challenge, he will take it and try to beat it, while the one with a Fixed Mindset will avoid it.
A Growth Mindsit believes that every hard mission needs effort to accomplish, but the Fixed one thinks that it is useless.
