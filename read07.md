# Programming with JavaScript

### Control flow:
**Control flow** is the order that the computer uses to excute a code.
The code is generally excuted from the *first* to the *last* line orderly, but in some cases there are loopes and conditions that controles how the the computer sees the code and which lines it sees first.

### Functions:
**Function** is a block of code that performes a specific task, and it is not excuted until you call it.


```
function square(number) {
  return number * number;
}
```

### Operators:

*JavaScript* has many types of **operators**, and I will talk about Two of them:

* **Assignment operators:** This operator gives a value to its left operand depending on the value on its right operand, for example:
  * `x = y` assigns the value of `y` to `x`

* **Comparison operators:** It compares the operands and gives a logical value (Like True or Fales). For example:
  * `4 == '4'` returns TRUE
  * `5 === '5'` returns FALSE
  * `4 > 9` returns FALSE
