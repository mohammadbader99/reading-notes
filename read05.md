# Operators and Loops

### Operators:

*JavaScript* has many types of **operators**, and I will talk about Two of them:

* **Assignment operators:** This operator gives a value to its left operand depending on the value on its right operand, for example:
  * `x = y` assigns the value of `y` to `x`

* **Comparison operators:** It compares the operands and gives a logical value (Like True or Fales). For example:
  * `4 == '4'` returns TRUE
  * `5 === '5'` returns FALSE
  * `4 > 9` returns FALSE

### Loops:

Loops is a method to do some operations repeatedly, like multiplying 3 by 7 for 12 times, and sometimes it depends on a condition.
Some loops types in JavaScript:
* For loops.
* Do while loops.
* While loop.
