# Forms and JS Events

## Forms

We can create **forms** using the `<form>` element.
The forms are used to take information from the user or visitor, after collecting the information it sends the data in name/value pairs.

Form controls have names, and the text or values that are entered in them are sent to the server.

### Control the appear of forms:

There are several ways to control the appearance of lists, forms and tables.
For example in CSS we can give different appearances using:
* `list-style-type`
* `list-style`

Also table cells can have different borders and styles.

## JS Events

Events are the way that the browser tells and knows when something has happened (like clicking a button or knowing that the loading has finished).

When an event is happening with an element, it can trigger a JS function or file, and it may pop-up something for you or even change the web page form.
