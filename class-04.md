### CSS Layout
**CSS** sees every HTML element as a seperated box, and it can control the size and dimentions of the box, such as:
* Borders
* Margin
* Padding

CSS can also transfer the block level boxes to inline boxes and the inline boxes to block level boxes using:
* `display: inline;`
* `display: inline-block;`

It also can be used to change the color or the size of the font in a web page, we can controle the places of the paragraphs or visual documents and where to view it on the web page. It also can add effects and animations.
