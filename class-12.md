# Chart.js, Canvas

## Chart.js API.

**Charts** are significantly better at graphically displaying data than tables, and they have the extra virtue of never being forced into usage as a layout tool. They’re more convenient to look at and transmit information fast, but they’re not necessarily simple to make. Chart.js, a *JavaScript plugin* that leverages HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page, is an excellent way to get started with charts. It’s a well-documented plugin that makes creating bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and other graphs a breeze.
